Book: joshua
Yahweh, the God of the Father, the Father of Jesus

Book: jonah
The three-year-old is not the religion of the Reich. 

Book: job
From the time of his death, he was delayed in the procession 

Book: lamentations
In it, there is no doubt that the power of the motherfucker is to increase the number of people who are in need of help. 


Book: judges
They are the first two days in the history of the Lord of Hosts.

In the case of a subdivision, a new law applies to the daughter of the one who is still living in the city, and in the case of the Rishon LeZion, there is a plan for the army


Book: IIkings
In the name of the Lord of the Covenant, the Lord of Hosts, Yes, I will speak to the great thunder of the thunder, and I will hear the voice of the Lord

## Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS)

<br />Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg (WRR) define an Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) as a sequence of letters in the text whose positions - not counting spaces - form an arithmetic progression. That is to say the letters are found at the positions

n, n + d, n + 2d, ..., n + (k - 1)d

WRR define n as the start, d as the skip between letters in the search-term, and k as the length of the ELS. These three parameters uniquely identify the ELS which is denoted (n, d, k).

## Probability of sequence existence

A way to ensure the faith in the method is directly linked to the probability of generate common sense sentences from the ELS algorithm, is not the same search words of 8 digits than 16 inside the same number of characters (each book)

We need to estimate propertly the probability of ELS generated sequences , is normal appears 100 symbols repetly ? , or long sentence describing modern cities ?, how plausible is something ?

Many uninitiated in kabala might think the results are gimmicks or casual . A math indicators will convince the unitiated .

## Probable encoded sentences

- The sencente have a logical estructure and can be True Or False

- The sentence gematria sumatory value respect to the global number of characters need to be smaller than 10, you can adjust the percentege to ensure the results over the random entropy of the data .

- H(n*book_chars) == H(n*Random)

## Holy Books Forecasting

Artificial intelligence methods allow us to make more complex calculations over pre trained models, or extract the function informacion of a dataset to compose a function.

By this way we can extend the ELS methods as a infinite data series . 

### AI ELS methods

- Extending books

Pre train a model with a holy book, and generate alternative futures over the end .

- Extending gematria datasets

Converting words to gematria and extending to infinite as a sequence


## XGboost pattern (XG-ELS, search for unprobable patterns based on linear regresions

- Convert word to gematria sequence , extend sequence with xgboost prediction until user selection number of loops, sum sequence, search for ELS

- Load book, extend him until user selection , search by ELS

- Gematria regressor classificator and forecasting

- Support for Missing Data

## Probnet deterministic geometric or arithmetic functions sequences

- Convert word to gematria sequence , extend sequence with xgboost prediction until user selection number of loops, sum sequence, search for ELS

- Load book, extend him until user selection , search by ELS

- Gematria geometric classificator

- Gematria arithmetic classificator

## Baphomet AI model

- XGBOOST (Work on progress training models over linear regresion)

  Pretained genesis and original repository books of Torah Bible Code

  Allow to generate new book ends and order permutations .
  
  An artificial intelligence algorithm can priorize order combinations with the trained common sense of the "pre ordered Torah", reducing computation costs to find results .

## Torah encoding analisys

- Language symbols

- Geometry

- Gematria

- Symbol Frequency in Holy writings

- Shannon's Entropy

- Functional encoding patterns

- Information density

- Kabala derivations

- Past, Present and Future

- Similar sentences to other antique books
