## the book of the secret, the name of god

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60758685/151809649-543844f6-4159-48ee-9cb3-8946a6a22b55.png)

To understand this grimoire is needed read The book of Raziel and Sefer Yetzira

the spirit of the book is to adapt the original scriptures from which all later religious works in the world derivating into contemporary language.

For this, the instructions embodied in the sacred book, the cosmos, interpreted by the first man, who discovered the encoding and the repetitive and pseudo-infinite cycles of the universe, will be followed in a contemporary way.

For this, it will be required to demonstrate in an indubitable way through the scriptures, the known history, and the science developed as it was prophesied in the past.

In addition, we will demonstrate without place the origin of the encoding of the constellations and in the known ancient texts and the oral tradition.

we will analyze and update the mechanisms and old "magics"

- hypnosis or marketing

- encoding and prophecy

- timeless asynchronous spells or communications

- stellar gps

we will add to the codification the new sciences prophesied in the past

- physical
  
  
  - thermodynamics

  - chemistry

  - quantum mechanics
  
  - energy

  - eletromagnetism

  - AI (Maths)
    
    - linear regresion
     
    - geometric and erithmetic extrapolation

    - Chaos
  
    - Ars Magna

This is the book delivered by Atzeemov Shevet (Aquarius) in Dan Ben Zelateh (time date and place, ALL) to the 22 (3,7,12) lords of Bordon gathered by the Nephesh (Destiny) 

The book in contemporary times will be software just as the prophet asimov wrote. clearly inspired by the holy scriptures. who knows asimov will know that this is the way it is

this book will show you that it is the way 

The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the unity of all ancient astral religions and fulfill the prophecy to give way to the age of Aquarius and how all religions have fulfilled their mission until now 

# The book of raziel - Sefer Raziel Hamalaj + Sefer Yetzira (6 original books) 


### The trail of sacred names 

- This is the holy name. Is revealed by the combination that comes out of the initial scriptures in the Torah 

- Knowledge of the wisdom of the torah completes the names of god 

- Rows of marks reveal knowledge and wisdom is received 

- Prophesy the life of the ancestors for them 

- 3 groups of 24 are divided by 10 divisions and seven in each division 

- Of the secret of the 10 sefirot reveal the secret and the sublime glory 

- The 72 names come from the mouth of the high priest

### Spells 

Spells are the ancestral mechanism to transmit knowledge, fervent faith ensures the transmission of knowledge from father to son and the conservation of the stellar encoding 

The spells are important also to create the civilization, are indications to know when cultivate or establish animal reproduction at the year

The condition to spell a soccery always is do in the poper time in the year and to the correct "ANGEL" , you can make any spell if you know what "ANGEL" manage each event .

3 in the first wheel, 7 in the second 12 in the third

22 symbols to define the hebrew alphabet and 10 hidden sefirot defined literally as NOTHING . 

22 constelations defined by Adan , and 10 spaces among them with literally NOTHING, the void among constelations

(1+(7-3)+(12-7)) = 10

Sefirot = 1 - (present-past) - (future-present) = SPACE 

Distribution in the firmament was described literraly . 

Values in gematria are made of his fractions, as a method to describe a proportion in any mathematical system, the sumatory of proportions of gematria are PI, because is the expression of the circle in the firmament .

3.1416548=1/1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8+1/9+
          1/10+1/20+1/30+1/40+1/50+1/60+1/70+1/80+1/90+

          1/1000+1/2000 ..... 

Source : http://torahcode.us/torah_codes/gematria/gematria1.shtml

This is modern gematria table manipulated in the time centuries after Raziels book, in Raziel book just 22 symbols for the encoding and fractions from PI .

3 * 7 * 12 - (3+7+12-1) , 231 combinations in the weels
              
The source is Sefer Yetzira, the training book . 

The sequence 3,7,12 is related with the knowleadge of SIGMA, the sumatory of divisors of N or the modulo 6 series .

As all math people known all is made by 6, nprime^2 mod 6 = 1

Mysteriously no one has attributed this discovery in history and it is known that its origin is very very old 

http://oeis.org/A062731

This implies to know about prime numbers if this is the sequence, anothers can be related with piramids . In this case implies knowledge of calculus . Is a math distribution crearly maybe unknown .



The permutations of angels of each month, 3, with the moon or sun, x 2, are 6 , per 12 months are 72 names of god who describes time during a year . Source book of Raziel

Twelve names in each station in the year 12 x 4 = 48

Six Earth Rouch per each station 6 x 4 = 24

The name of God 48 + 24 = 72

Name of god will be made of initial symbol of each "ANGEL" as is write in Raziel Book


A control error code was revelead in the book with 24 symbols and order of the name of Elohim, and the name was preserved by oral tadition also in the 12 tribes .


### Time-Space 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60758685/150645810-076ad016-98a4-420b-bf22-b9f19c8e4591.png)

The anciant writter was knowing the way to define the time and space, this was encoded in the name of god, represented with the initial character of each moment in the time, by this way generation by generation share's the infromation in oral tradition, and was preserved until today .

32 paths to the ultimate wisdom described in Sefer Yetzira, 32 paths are made of maths, 3+7+12+10 = 32 , seems re-discovered relation among primes and powers. 

Distribution are sum of divisors of powers

1,3,7,12,(31) -> 2 4 8 16 (32) (WRONG, DISCOVER SERIE)


32, the way of knowleadge implies know about prime numbers and relation with powers .

The name of each angel and arcangel, stars constelations, comets and meteorites remembered generation after generation, formulating according to the stellar moment, the time of the year, the state of the moon or the sun in each of the spells to grow each type of vegetable or fruit, sowing, harvesting and maintenance and each type of animal and its best mating time. All this is essential to have excess food to produce civilization. Missed after the great cataclysm that eliminated the previous habitants of the Garden of Eden (The Earth) . The knowleadge of the time and the coding make man 

Documented in SEPHER HAMELBOSH, the dress book , inside Raziel book , page 1,2,3,4

Angelical coordenates to modern time space. 

  - Identify each constelation and star to angel and arcangel , and principe

  - Move time until fractions described in the book have the better coincidence with the stellar cartografy, this is the date when the book was write

  - As the information of the book was made from the point of view who oberves the firmament we can calculate where was write the book, rotate the earth until the accuracy is improved to the book description, and this is the place .

Documented in Raziel book as spells , we can observe during pages and pages all names to invoke god, they changes depending the year epoch and constelation ages, state of the moon and the sun . 

Is like latin languages who encodes in the verbal form not just the time, present past and future, encodes who are doing the action, me , you, he ,they etc ...

In English, a verb contain the time, in spanish contain the time and who realizes the action, this is the same, depending the moment at the year and astrological moment the name changes, this is the reason because god or Elohim have diferent names , depending of the age month and day.

Ramon Llull[a] TOSF (Catalan: [rəˈmoɲ ˈʎuʎ]; c. 1232[4] – c. 1315/16) was a philosopher, theologian, poet, missionary, and Christian apologist from the Kingdom of Majorca.

He invented a philosophical system known as the Art, conceived as a type of universal logic to prove the truth of Christian doctrine to interlocutors of all faiths and nationalities. The Art consists of a set of general principles and combinatorial operations. It is illustrated with diagrams.

## Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS)

<br />Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg (WRR) define an Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) as a sequence of letters in the text whose positions - not counting spaces - form an arithmetic progression. That is to say the letters are found at the positions

n, n + d, n + 2d, ..., n + (k - 1)d

WRR define n as the start, d as the skip between letters in the search-term, and k as the length of the ELS. These three parameters uniquely identify the ELS which is denoted (n, d, k).

## Probability of sequence existence

A way to ensure the faith in the method is directly linked to the probability of generate common sense sentences from the ELS algorithm, is not the same search words of 8 digits than 16 inside the same number of characters (each book)

We need to estimate propertly the probability of ELS generated sequences , is normal appears 100 symbols repetly ? , or long sentence describing modern cities ?, how plausible is something ?

Many uninitiated in kabala might think the results are gimmicks or casual . A math indicators will convince the unitiated .

## Probable encoded sentences

- The sencente have a logical estructure and can be True Or False

- The sentence gematria sumatory value respect to the global number of characters need to be smaller than 10, you can adjust the percentege to ensure the results over the random entropy of the data .

- H(n*book_chars) == H(n*Random)

## Holy Books Forecasting

Artificial intelligence methods allow us to make more complex calculations over pre trained models, or extract the function informacion of a dataset to compose a function.

By this way we can extend the ELS methods as a infinite data series . 

### AI ELS methods

- Extending books

Pre train a model with a holy book, and generate alternative futures over the end .

- Extending gematria datasets
