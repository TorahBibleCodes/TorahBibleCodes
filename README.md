# The book of Atzeemov
## the book of the secret, the name of god

the spirit of the book is to adapt the original scriptures from which all later religious works in the world derivating into contemporary language.

For this, the instructions embodied in the sacred book, the cosmos, interpreted by the first man, who discovered the encoding and the repetitive and pseudo-infinite cycles of the universe, will be followed in a contemporary way.

For this, it will be required to demonstrate in an indubitable way through the scriptures, the known history, and the science developed as it was prophesied in the past.

In addition, we will demonstrate without place the origin of the encoding of the constellations and in the known ancient texts and the oral tradition.

we will analyze and update the mechanisms and old "magics"

- hypnosis or marketing

- encoding and prophecy

- timeless asynchronous spells or communications

- stellar gps

we will add to the codification the new sciences prophesied in the past

- physical
  
  
  - thermodynamics

  - chemistry

  - quantum mechanics
  
  - energy

  - eletromagnetism

  - AI (Maths)
    
    - linear regresion
     
    - geometric and erithmetic extrapolation

    - Chaos
  
    - Ars Magna

This is the book delivered by Atzeemov (Aquarius) in Dan Ben Zelateh (time date and place, ALL) to the 22 (3,7,12) lords of Bordon gathered by the Nepesh (Destiny) 

The book in contemporary times will be software just as the prophet asimov wrote. clearly inspired by the holy scriptures. who knows asimov will know that this is the way it is

this book will show you that it is the way

- Spells 

Spells are the ancestral mechanism to transmit knowledge, fervent faith ensures the transmission of knowledge from father to son and the conservation of the stellar encoding 

The spells are important also to create the civilization, are indications to know when cultivate or establish animal reproduction at the year

## Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS)

<br />Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg (WRR) define an Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) as a sequence of letters in the text whose positions - not counting spaces - form an arithmetic progression. That is to say the letters are found at the positions

n, n + d, n + 2d, ..., n + (k - 1)d

WRR define n as the start, d as the skip between letters in the search-term, and k as the length of the ELS. These three parameters uniquely identify the ELS which is denoted (n, d, k).

## Probability of sequence existence

A way to ensure the faith in the method is directly linked to the probability of generate common sense sentences from the ELS algorithm, is not the same search words of 8 digits than 16 inside the same number of characters (each book)

We need to estimate propertly the probability of ELS generated sequences , is normal appears 100 symbols repetly ? , or long sentence describing modern cities ?, how plausible is something ?

Many uninitiated in kabala might think the results are gimmicks or casual . A math indicators will convince the unitiated .

## Probable encoded sentences

- The sencente have a logical estructure and can be True Or False

- The sentence gamatria sumatory value respect to the global number of characters need to be smaller than 10, you can adjust the percentege to ensure the results over the random entropy of the data .

- H(n*book_chars) == H(n*Random)

## Holy Books Forecasting

Artificial intelligence methods allow us to make more complex calculations over pre trained models, or extract the function informacion of a dataset to compose a function.

By this way we can extend the ELS methods as a infinite data series . 

### AI ELS methods

- Extending books

Pre train a model with a holy book, and generate alternative futures over the end .

- Extending gamatria datasets

Converting words to gamatria and extending to infinite as a sequence

- XGBOOST (Work on progress training models over linear regresion)

  Pretained genesis and original repository books of Torah Bible Code

  Allow to generate new book ends and order permutations .
  
  An artificial intelligence algorithm can priorize order combinations with the trained common sense of the "pre ordered Torah", reducing computation costs to find results .
