## Usage

`python3 TBC.py`

Run main program

`use conversions`

Load module

`searchnumber x`

Search ELS at x space distance .

`search words`

Convert words to numbers in gamatry, sums and executes ELS function over sumatory distances.

## Modules

- Conversions , search and make conversion

- Publish, load and share on a blockchain your search results to provide data for a search engine

## Current Development Status

Active Development: In Progress

## Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS)

<br />Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg (WRR) define an Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) as a sequence of letters in the text whose positions - not counting spaces - form an arithmetic progression. That is to say the letters are found at the positions

n, n + d, n + 2d, ..., n + (k - 1)d

WRR define n as the start, d as the skip between letters in the search-term, and k as the length of the ELS. These three parameters uniquely identify the ELS which is denoted (n, d, k).

## XGboost pattern (XG-ELS, search for unprobable patterns basen on linear regresions, pending iface)

- Convert word to gematria sequence , extend sequence with xgboost prediction until user selection number of loops, sum sequence, search for ELS

- Load book, extend him until user selection , search by ELS

## Probnet deterministic patterns from 100 % accuracy geometrical or arthmetic functions sequencces, (pending iface)

- Convert word to gematria sequence , extend sequence with xgboost prediction until user selection number of loops, sum sequence, search for ELS

- Load book, extend him until user selection , search by ELS
